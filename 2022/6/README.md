# Day 6
Wow, that was quick! I had to fight with the parsing part for day 5 and I lost A LOT of time on that puzzle, and I started to be quite disappointed: headache and so much effort already at day 5? Am I dumb or what? ðŸ¥²

Then I did this puzzle... I think it could be a good day 1 or 2.

Nice and clean, let's go for day 7 ðŸ’ª
