# Day 2
Today was also easy, I would say practically as easy as yesterday.

This time I focused on **readability**, yesterday I tried to be as concise as possible (I also played golfing ðŸ¤£ ) instead.
In some lines, it might be" too readable" becoming almost redundant, but as I said, I wanted to play with readability and try to get as close to natural language as possible, with as little redundancy as possible.

I still enjoy this moment when I can think about these things, I know that from a certain point on there is no more room for these superficialities and I will have to give 100% to at least solve the puzzle.

I can't wait for tomorrow!
