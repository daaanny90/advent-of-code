# Day 3

A bit of a rush on this one. Yesterday I didn't have time to solve day 3 and now I have to solve two puzzles on day 4 evening.

This one is also quite easy. Because of the hurry, I solved it without checking the quality of the code, sorry, but the stars were more important.

Sometimes (often) it also happens in the real world with real problems: there is no time, no budget and the feature has to be deployed yesterday ðŸ¤ª
