# Day 5

Wow, what a headache! I wasted a LOT of time with this puzzle. At first, I tried to clean up the input that wasn't needed, and then to "rotate" the array to work with it better.

Right at this point, I got stuck in continuous for loops nested between them. And that wasn't working.

Finally, something clicked and I saw the exercise for what it was.

I'm glad I put it behind me :)
