# Day 4
I solved this along with Day 3 (see Day 3 readme).

When I first read the puzzle description, I thought, "Crap, Day 4 and it's already going to be challenging!" but ... it was actually quite easy. I guess I'm just tired ðŸ« 

The solution sucks, I don't like it.

But I have to be a little soft on myself. It's almost midnight, I had a hard day with my 2-year-old daughter and finally got back on track by solving two puzzles in a row.

4 Stars today, that's what matters. ðŸ¤˜
